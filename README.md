# MCDS_mrds_compare

This repo contains code, in MCDS-dot-exe-Report.Rmd and Support.R, that allows comparison of results of distance sampling detection function fit analyses via the `ds` function in the `Distance` package using the default R-based optimiser and using the `mcds.exe` optimiser.  See the report for more details.

Note, this report was compiled using a version of `Distance` before 2.0.0 and needs to be re-run to give an accurate picture of performance under the current package, where optimization has been considerably improved.
