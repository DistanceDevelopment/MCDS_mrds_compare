# MCDS_mrds_compare

This repo contains code, in MCDS-dot-exe-Report.Rmd and Support.R, that allows comparison of results of distance sampling detection function fit analyses via the `ds` function in the `Distance` package using the default R-based optimiser and using the `mcds.exe` optimiser.  See the report for more details.
